# IGPU-AutomodPlus
IGPU Automod with driver spoofing to get the UHD P630 on every device (and shows as UHD P630 when installed) - ment for 7-10th gen drivers

## How To Use
1. Install [the stock driver](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/776137/intel-7th-10th-gen-processor-graphics-windows.html)
2. Use any tool to extract the file, i recomend [7-Zip ZS](https://github.com/mcmilk/7-Zip-zstd/releases)
3. Run "automod.ps1", and choose what you want - i recomend just pressing y on all 3 for best performance
4. Run "disable driver signiture (run as admin).bat" and when it reboots run "installer.bat" to open "installer.exe" in a way that bypasses the unsigned driver warning
5. Run "enable driver signiture (run as admin).bat" and done!

# Enjoy!
